# patientTruth

A platform using OpenAI technology focused in close the communication gap between an immigrant in a foreign country and GPs.

PatientTruth aims to collect information in their native language about the patient's symptoms and it's behaviour, complement with their health history, to in the end create a case presentation in the GP's native language.

Soft Solution 1: Avoid any miscommunication and facilitate the initial contact between GP and Patient.
Soft Solution 2: Create a first reflection with the patient about their health history.
